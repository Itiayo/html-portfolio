  My dream university is university of oxford and stanford university. I'd really love to study mathematics in one of the 
  best universities in the world, I dream to bring in new formulas and to make mathematics easy for everyone. I'd love to do a research 
  on how we use mathematics unconsciously in our everyday lives. I'd also like to make a research on how broad mathematics is and how it's 
  the best problem solving tool.
